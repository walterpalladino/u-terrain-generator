# u-terrain-generator

Terrain Generator and Vegetation Spawner for Unity Terrain.



## Features covered so far

 - Terrain generator allowing to create tillable areas or masked islands.
 - Spawner including trees, bushes, rocks and grass.
 - Terrain Generator and Vegetation Spawner are independants features.


### Special Notes

- Terrain generator:
 - All layers are created from the script. To identify the layers the terrain name is used as part of the layer name so do not use duplicate terrain names.
 

## Render Pipelines
The actual project is using URP but the scripts are agnostics so you can used on SRP or HRDP


## Whats comes next
- Improvements for terrain generation
- Improvements for vegetation spawner
- Masks to avoid vegetation spawner
